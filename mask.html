            <li>Masks may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others.</li>
            <li>Masks are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.</li>
            <li>Masks should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</li>
            <li>Masks with exhalation valves or vents should NOT be worn to help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others (source control).</li>
        </ol>
